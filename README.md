# Event Management by cristian cano  
Welcome to the **Event Management** application.

This web platform allows users to organize, view, and register for events quickly and easily.

---

## What can you do in the application?

- **View available events:**
All visitors can see the list of events, their dates, descriptions, and the number of registered participants.

- **Register for events:**
If you are a registered user, you can register for any event with available seats.

- **Cancel your registration:**
If you can no longer attend an event, you can easily cancel your registration from the same platform.

- **User registration and access:**
You can create an account with your username and password. If the username is already in use, the app will notify you to choose another one.

- **Administration Panel (for administrators only):**
Administrators can create new events, edit existing ones, and delete them.
They can also see how many people are registered for each event.

## What is the visual experience like?

- The app has a modern, clear, and mobile-friendly design.
- Events are displayed on eye-catching cards, with buttons to register or unregister.
- Administrators see pencil (for editing) and trash (for deleting) icons next to each event.
- The top menu allows easy navigation between the main sections: Home, Dashboard, Login, Register, and Logout.

## What do you need to use it?

- You only need a modern web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Also use the following commands: npm install json-server.
- In a new terminal, also use the command npm install -g vite.
- Then, in the terminal where json-server was installed, use the command npm run server.
- Once the above is executed, run npm run dev in the terminal where vite is located. When finished, something like this should appear: "http://localhost:5173/" Just copy and paste it into your web browser and enjoy!
